to connect S3 bucket with shell or server we need IAM user for connect from sserver to s3 bucket and run command for this we need AWS CLI  

#install AWS CLI to server

  221  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
  222  unzip awscliv2.zip
  223  sudo ./aws/install
  224  ls
  225  sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update
  234  aws --version

configure AWS With server we need iam accwss and secrect key
which we can crate in aws UI -> while create IAM on permission we can give full access to S3

after createing access key and secrate key for IAM user we can use in aws CLI for aws configure

  
235  aws configure

now it is connected with aws services 
now we can sync our dir. or backup or data to s3 bucket so it is stored their

command - aws s3 sync /home/ubuntu/shell s3://shell-backup-8788

/home/ubuntu/shell --> path where data is
shell-backup-8788 --> S3 bucket name

sync is it will add data not in s3
